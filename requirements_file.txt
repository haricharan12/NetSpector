## Requirements and Execution Steps

### 1. Packet Capture (packet_capture.c)

**Requirements**:
C Compiler (like GCC for Linux/Mac or MinGW for Windows).
Libpcap library installed on Unix-based systems or WinPcap/Npcap on Windows.

**Execution:**
  - Compile the C code: gcc packet_capture.c -o packet_capture -lpcap (Linux/Mac) or use a corresponding command in Windows.
  - Run the executable: ./packet_capture on Unix-based systems or packet_capture.exe on Windows.
  - The script will save the captured packets in a .pcap file.

### 2. Anomaly Detection and Analysis (data_analysis_ml.py)

**Requirements:**
  - Python environment (Python 3.x).
  - Python libraries: Scapy, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn. Install them using pip install scapy numpy pandas scikit-learn.
  - The .pcap file generated by the previous step.

**Execution:**
  - Run the script: python data_analysis_ml.py.
  - Ensure the script points to the correct .pcap file location.
  - The script will analyze the packet data and output a CSV file (anomalies.csv) with detailed information about each packet and its anomaly status.

### 3. Data Visualization (visualize_anomalies.py)

**Requirements:**
  - Python environment.
  - Python libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas. Install them using pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas.
  - The anomalies.csv file generated by the anomaly detection script.

**Execution:**
  - Run the script: python visualize_anomalies.py.
  - The script reads from anomalies.csv and generates visualizations like anomaly timelines, protocol distributions, and IP frequency charts.

### 4. Integrated Workflow (if applicable)

**Requirements:**
  - All the requirements mentioned in the above steps.
  - Ensure all scripts (packet_capture.c, data_analysis_ml.py, visualize_anomalies.py) are correctly placed and accessible.

**Execution:**
  - A master script (e.g., main.py) can be created to run these scripts sequentially.
  - This integrated script would first invoke the packet capturing, then the analysis script, and finally the visualization script.
